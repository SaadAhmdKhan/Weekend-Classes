    <h1>Wikipedia:</h1>
    <p>Wikipedia, often referred to as the "free encyclopedia," is a vast online resource that provides information on a wide range of topics. It is collaboratively edited and maintained by volunteers around the world, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive reference works available. <b><i>Founded in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger</b></i></p>
    <p>Wikipedia has grown to include millions of articles in multiple languages, covering subjects such as history, science, technology, culture, and more. While its open-editing model has been subject to criticism for potential inaccuracies and biases, Wikipedia remains a valuable source of information for millions of users worldwide, serving as a starting point for research and exploration on virtually any topic imaginable.</p>
